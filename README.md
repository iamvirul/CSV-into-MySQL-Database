# Project Title

The CVS-into-MySQL-Database project is a PHP-based tool designed to read data from CSV files and seamlessly import it into a MySQL database. This straightforward system aims to simplify the process of transferring data from CSV files into a structured MySQL database.


## Key Features

1. **CSV File Upload**: Users can upload CSV files through a user-friendly interface.
2. **Data Parsing:** The PHP script parses the CSV file, extracting data according to predefined rules.
3. **MySQL Database Integration:** Parsed data is then inserted into a MySQL database, creating or updating records as necessary.
4. **Error Handling:** The system includes basic error handling mechanisms to notify users in case of any issues during the import process.
5. **User Feedback:** Users receive feedback on the success or failure of the import operation, making the process transparent and user-friendly.
## Run Locally
